## NODE Chalk Workshop

# This workshop is designed to walk you through step by step the basic concepts of NPM / NODE

# Run the commands in the following order:

- git clone https://github.com/connorltodd/node-chalk-workshop.git
- cd node-chalk-workshop
- create the index.js file (touch index.js)
- npm init  (COMMAND LINE) (This initialises npm for us to begin installing modules)
- npm install chalk (COMMAND LINE) (This installs the npm package chalk)
- inside the index.js file use the chalk module to console.log 4 wilders names
- Add a script to your package.json in the scripts section
- e.g. "start": "node index.js"
- Go to your command line and type "npm run start"
- You should now see the console.log of your fellow wilders in the colours you have set
